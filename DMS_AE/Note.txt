The implementation is as follows:
  
  In train_and_forecast.py , we train the parametric models and make the relevant forecasts based on the parametric models. These forecasts (and parameters when necessary) are stored in the designated directories.
  In Fast_DMS.py , we perform DMS and efficiently scanning through all the hyperparameters desired.
  In Fast_AE.py , we perform AE and efficiently scanning through all the hyperparameters desired.
